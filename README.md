🧠 Intelligent Recommendation System for Personalized Individual Development Plans (IDPs)
📌 Problem Statement ID: 25194
📌 Smart India Hackathon 2025 – POWERGRID
📖 Overview

The POWERGRID Succession Planning & Leadership Development Policy uses a 9-Box Performance-Potential Matrix to identify future leaders. However, creating personalized, data-driven Individual Development Plans (IDPs) manually is challenging and time-consuming.

This project provides an AI-powered Intelligent Recommendation System that:

Analyzes employee data (performance, experience, assessments).

Identifies competency gaps between the employee and their target leadership role.

Recommends personalized development activities (training modules, job rotations, mentorships).

Provides dashboards for both employees and HR/committee to monitor progress.
